# Rgauge
Functions for rain gauge calibration and processing of their data designed specifically for rain gauges and weather stations manufactured
by  FIEDLER AMS s.r.o. (https://www.fiedler.company/)

The repo is currently not ready to be directly compiled to R package, i.e. lib_RGcalib.r file needs to be downloaded and sourced.
The functions include comments which mostly provide a basic info what a function does and an info about the arguments and outputs
of a function. The functions are intended for these tasks:
- evaluation of laboratory (dynamic) calibraiton of rain gauges
- dynamic calibration of rain gauge data
- reading of logged data (in different formates)
- data cleaning and processing
- analysis of rain gauge data
